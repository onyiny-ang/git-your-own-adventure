# You Have Decided to Clone the Repo

Not a bad choice. Not bad at all. Especially if you are the author of this repo
and you want to have a local copy to make your changes on and sync with github.

If you want to contribute to someone elses' repo though, it can make things a bit
more complicated. Especially if there are a lot of people working on the same repo.
Consider this: say you think the repo is really great, except for that one thing
that reminds you why you hate everything about computers. There's no need to be annoyed, you
realize, because you have the power to change it!

It would be nice to have a backup of your changes somewhere on the interwebs so you can easily port it to your other machines, though. You _could_ make a new branch for your changes, but your clone is still set to push to the original repo. Do you really want everyone to see your branch when they're browsing through the original repo? What if the original owner has turned protections on their repo that prevent you from pushing to it directly? Of course, you can change your local settings so the remote location your repo is pointing to is a brand new space on your github account that you've created just for you, and push your clone there, but if you want to pull any new developments in from the original, it will be complicated.

Are you starting to think maybe cloning isn't what you wanted to do? Don't worry! There's still time to take that left turn at the [Fork](fork.md)!?

More of a spoon person? Well, I tried.

To clone this repo open a terminal and navigate to wherever you clone git repos. Then enter the following magic words:

`git clone https://github.com/onyiny-ang/git-your-own-adventure`

Navigate in to the directory and there's your repo!

If you want to continue being part of the story, things are probably going
to get complicated from here on out--but fear not! We will figure it out together!
