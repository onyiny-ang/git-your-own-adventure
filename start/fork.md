# You Have Decided to Fork the Repo

Good. For our purposes, this is the best choice.

But what is a fork anyway?

![Little Mermaid - FORK](http://fanaru.com/the-little-mermaid/image/94888-the-little-mermaid-ariel.gif)

A fork gives you a full copy of the repo that you are free to clone and change
as you please with all the functionality of your own git repo. When combined
with a git organization and a large team, forking makes a lot of
sense--especially when you're working with developers who are brand new and not
as experienced with git workflows. A fork helps to ensure that there is always
a source of truth that remains in tact and untouched by bad/harmful code/git
commands--no matter how badly you screw up your personal fork.

Go ahead and fork it by clicking on the fork button at the top right of the repo.
