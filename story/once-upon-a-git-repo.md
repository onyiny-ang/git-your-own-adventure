# Once Upon A Git Repo

Indigo sat down at the computer again and winced.
In the time it took to make another espresso (already the 5th one today), the number of notifications on the git repo
that was just pushed this morning were already in the hundreds.

How was anyone supposed to keep up with these damn github notifications, anyway?

Indigo had turned off email notifications months ago, but the little blue
dot in the top right corner of the browser served as a constant reminder of the
unattended messages and issues, the unreviewed pull requests and merge conflicts
that had no easy resolution. Somedays, Indigo wished for an extended holiday on a remote
island without computers. Hell, without electricity. Today was definitely one of those
days.

"Welp. I guess I better get to it," Indigo sighed.
